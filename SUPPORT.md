# Support

## Where to Ask What

- **How-to / usage questions**: GitHub Discussions
- **Reproducible defects**: GitHub Issues (use bug template)
- **Feature requests**: GitHub Issues (use feature template)
- **Security concerns**: `SECURITY.md` process only

## Maintainer Expectations

- Best-effort responses
- Lean triage with strict scope control
- Reproducibility required for bug acceptance

## Support Boundaries

- No custom consulting via issues/discussions
- No private troubleshooting without a reproducible case
- Out-of-scope requests may be labeled `status:out-of-scope` and closed

## Incomplete Report Policy

Issues labeled `status:needs-repro` may be auto-closed if no reproducible details are provided within the configured window.
