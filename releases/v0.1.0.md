# TheWorkshop `v0.1.0` - Codex/Claude Code Skill Launch

TheWorkshop is a **skill for Codex and Claude Code** that runs non-coding work through a structured workflow with explicit gates, orchestration, monitoring, and spend visibility.

## What Is Included

- Project -> Workstreams -> Jobs workflow model
- Agreement, dependency/freshness, TruthGate, and reward-gated completion
- Status rollups and stale downstream invalidation
- Orchestration planning with parallel groups + critical path
- Dashboard with live monitoring and billing-aware spend visibility
- First-class image generation job path (`OPENAI_KEY` compatibility injection)
- Expanded scripted test coverage in `scripts/*_test.py`

## Known Limitations

- Billing detection may be heuristic when telemetry is incomplete
- Per-job spend attribution is allocation-based, not invoice-grade truth
- GitHub mirroring is opt-in and best-effort for board/project APIs
- Dashboard auto-open is best-effort and may be suppressed in headless environments

## Install Path

```bash
cp -R /path/to/theworkshop "$CODEX_HOME/skills/theworkshop"
```

## First-Run Verification

```bash
python3 scripts/doctor.py
python3 scripts/project_new.py --name "Release Smoke Project"
python3 scripts/plan_check.py --project /path/to/project
python3 scripts/dashboard_build.py --project /path/to/project
```
