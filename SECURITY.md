# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The `main` branch is considered the supported version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open public GitHub issues for suspected vulnerabilities.

Use one of these channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)
2. Private maintainer contact listed in repository settings

Report should include:

- Description of the issue
- Impact and affected paths
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept
- Proposed mitigation (if available)

## Response SLA Targets

- Acknowledgement: within 3 business days
- Initial triage update: within 7 business days
- Ongoing status updates: at least every 14 days until resolution

## Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure. Public disclosure happens after mitigation is ready or compensating controls are documented.
